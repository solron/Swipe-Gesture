# Swipe-Gesture

A simple swipe code showing how to create UISwipe handler and detect swipe gestures in ios.
It seems like you need to create one gesture recognizer for each direction. But you can send it to the same handler, and check for the direction there, or create one function for each direction. The method showed here is one handler for all directions.
